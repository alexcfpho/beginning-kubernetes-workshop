# Beginning Kubernetes Workshop

This workshop is intended to provide a hands-on introduction to Kubernetes, its core concepts, and some tooling built around it. It is (hopefully) designed to be conducted in a traditional workshop group setting or as a self-directed individual workshop.

To get started, head over to [the workshop](workshop.md).
